# SteadyNut Makerbeam XL

This little mod will turn ordinary M3 nuts turn into t-nuts for Makerbeam XL extrusions. Because of the friction fit, the nuts will stay in place and will prevent a lot of frustration of M3 nuts sliding out of the extrusions.

This mod is directly inspired by Discord user `zruncho V0.078` after he posted pictures of his SteadyNut made for his LDO profiles.
